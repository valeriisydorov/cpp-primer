Linear algebra is central to almost all areas of mathematics.
For instance, linear algebra is fundamental in modern presentations of geometry, including for defining basic objects such as lines, planes and rotations.
Also, functional analysis, a branch of mathematical analysis, may be viewed as the application of linear algebra to function spaces.
