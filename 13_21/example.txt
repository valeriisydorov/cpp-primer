In mathematics and computer science
an algorithm is a finite sequence of rigorous instructions
typically used to solve a class of specific problems or
to perform a computation
Algorithms are used as specifications for performing
calculations and data processing
More advanced algorithms can use conditionals
to divert the code execution through various routes
referred to as automated decision-making and deduce valid inferences
referred to as automated reasoning
achieving automation eventually
Using human characteristics as descriptors of
machines in metaphorical ways was already
practiced by Alan Turing with terms such as memory search and stimulus
In contrast a heuristic is an approach to problem solving
that may not be fully specified or may not guarantee correct
or optimal results especially in problem domains where
there is no well-defined correct or optimal result
As an effective method an algorithm can be expressed
within a finite amount of space and time
and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function
